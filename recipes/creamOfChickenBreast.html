    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This baked chicken with cream of chicken soup is made with boneless
      chicken breasts or chicken tenders covered with cream of chicken soup.
      Chicken, creamy chicken, everywhere!
    </p>
    <p>
      If desired, serve over egg noodles. You may substitute cream of chicken,
      half-and-half, or water for milk if desired.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 pinch poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
      <li>10 1/2 ounces milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish; season with poultry seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together condensed soup and milk in a bowl. Pour soup mixture evenly
        over chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center
        and juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted in the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
      </li>
    </ol>
